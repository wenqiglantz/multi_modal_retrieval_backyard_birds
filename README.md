# multi_modal_retrieval_backyard_birds

A little app I created for my bird-lover daughter. :-)

* Step 1: Download backyard birds text and images
* Step 2: Build text index for vector store using GPT embeddings
* Step 3: Build image index for vector store using CLIP embeddings
* Step 4: During query time, generate both text + CLIP query embeddings, retrieve both text + images
* Step 5: Get multimodal retrieval results for sample queries
